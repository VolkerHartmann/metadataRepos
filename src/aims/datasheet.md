# AIMS â€“ Applying Interoperable Metadata Standards

## Introduction
A platform for creating and sharing metadata schemas for better research data management in engineering. Implementing a modular metadata concept with a focus keeping interoperability while allowing highly specific description of metadata. In addition to a repository for subject-specific application profiles for subsequent use, it also provides a generator for their creation and improvement based on controlled vocabularies. These are supplemented by a repository in which validated metadata records corresponding to the application profiles can be published. Researchers can access all content on the platform via a central search function and easily reuse relevant content. The core idea of AIMS is to provide low-threshold access for an improved metadata management.
Technically build around RDF and SHACL based application profiles also with a focus on interoperability with existing standards, interfaces and semantic technologies.
